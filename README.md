# MetaLand - Advanced Virtual Real Estate Platform

## Project Description

MetaLand is a cutting-edge decentralized blockchain-based virtual land registry and marketplace platform with advanced features including bidding, auctions, rentals, taxation, and access control. This comprehensive smart contract system enables users to register virtual land parcels with detailed attributes, establish verifiable ownership, merge and split lands, create neighborhoods, participate in auctions, rent properties for passive income, and conduct secure peer-to-peer real estate transactions. Built on Ethereum-compatible networks, MetaLand eliminates intermediaries while ensuring transparency, security, and immutability of land ownership records. The platform features a sophisticated land development system, ownership history tracking, community-building tools through neighborhoods, and a complete economic ecosystem with platform fees and land taxation.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create the most comprehensive, feature-rich, and accessible platform for virtual land ownership in the emerging metaverse economy. MetaLand aims to democratize virtual real estate by providing a decentralized, transparent, and secure infrastructure where anyone can register, develop, trade, rent, auction, and manage digital land parcels with unprecedented detail and control. We envision a thriving digital economy where virtual property rights are respected, lands have unique characteristics and histories, communities flourish through neighborhood systems, and users can generate passive income through rentals and strategic trading. MetaLand is building the complete foundation for a metaverse where every parcel tells a story, creates value, and contributes to a vibrant virtual economy.

    5,                              // terrain: 0=Plains, 1=Mountains, 2=Forest, 3=Desert, 4=Coastal, 5=Urban
    true,                           // hasWater: true/false
    false,                          // hasMinerals: true/false
    true                            // hasEnergy: true/false
)

// Returns: Land ID (uint256)
```

**💡 Pro Tips:**
- Higher rarity = higher initial resource level (10-90 range)
- Epic/Legendary lands start with 70-90 resource levels
- Resources (water, minerals, energy) add value
- Commercial + Urban + Energy = High-value setup

---

### 🏪 Marketplace Operations

#### 3. List Land for Sale
```solidity
// List land #5 for 1 ETH
listLandForSale(5, 1000000000000000000)

// Parameters:
// - landId: Your land ID
// - price: Price in wei

// Quick reference:
// 1 ETH = 1000000000000000000 wei (18 zeros)
// 0.1 ETH = 100000000000000000 wei
// 0.01 ETH = 10000000000000000 wei
```

#### 4. Purchase Land
```solidity
// Buy land #5 (must send exact or higher value)
purchaseLand(5) 
// Send value with transaction

// The contract automatically:
// ✅ Transfers ownership to you
// ✅ Sends payment to previous owner
// ✅ Refunds any overpayment
// ✅ Updates ownership history
// ✅ Removes land from sale
```

**💡 Purchase Tips:**
- Always check `getLandDetails()` before buying
- Verify the land has desired attributes
- Check ownership history for legitimacy
- Consider development stage and resources

---

### 🔗 Advanced Land Management

#### 5. Merge Multiple Lands
Combine multiple adjacent lands into one larger estate:

```solidity
// Prepare array of land IDs to merge
uint256[] memory landsToMerge = new uint256[](3);
landsToMerge[0] = 10;  // Land #10
landsToMerge[1] = 11;  // Land #11
landsToMerge[2] = 12;  // Land #12

// Merge them into one
mergeLands(landsToMerge, "Grand Estate Complex")

// What happens:
// ✅ Total size = sum of all lands
// ✅ Resource level = average of all
// ✅ Development stage = maximum of all
// ✅ Rarity boost: 2-4 lands→Uncommon, 5-7→Rare, 8-10→Epic
// ✅ Inherits ALL resources (water, minerals, energy)
// ✅ Old lands deleted, new merged land created
```

**💡 Merge Strategy:**
- Merge 5+ lands for Rare rarity
- Merge 8+ lands for Epic rarity
- Merged lands cannot be unmerged
- Only merge lands you truly want to combine
- Great for creating premium estates

**Example Use Cases:**
- Small residential → Large estate
- Multiple commercial → Shopping district
- Agricultural parcels → Mega farm

---

#### 6. Split Large Lands
Divide one large land into multiple smaller parcels:

```solidity
// Split land #20 (10,000 sq meters) into 4 parcels
uint256[] memory sizes = new uint256[](4);
sizes[0] = 2500;  // 2500 sq meters
sizes[1] = 2500;  // 2500 sq meters
sizes[2] = 2500;  // 2500 sq meters
sizes[3] = 2500;  // 2500 sq meters

string[] memory locations = new string[](4);
locations[0] = "North Plot";
locations[1] = "South Plot";
locations[2] = "East Plot";
locations[3] = "West Plot";

splitLand(20, sizes, locations)

// Requirements:
// ⚠️ Total sizes MUST equal original land size exactly
// ⚠️ Can split into 2-10 parcels only
// ⚠️ Land must NOT be listed for sale

// What happens:
// ✅ Creates 4 new independent lands
// ✅ Each gets 80% of original resource level
// ✅ All become Common rarity
// ✅ Development stage resets to 0
// ✅ Original land is deleted
```

**💡 Split Strategy:**
- Split large lands to sell individually
- Create smaller affordable parcels
- Diversify your portfolio
- Each split can be developed independently
- Good for liquidity needs

**Example Use Cases:**
- Large estate → Residential lots
- Mega farm → Individual farms
- Industrial zone → Multiple factories

---

#### 7. Develop Your Land
Upgrade your land's development stage and boost resource levels:

```solidity
// Develop land #15
developLand(15)

// Each call:
// ✅ Increases development stage by 1 (max 10)
// ✅ Increases resource level by 5 (max 100)

// Call multiple times to fully develop:
developLand(15)  // Stage 0 → 1
developLand(15)  // Stage 1 → 2
developLand(15)  // Stage 2 → 3
// ... continue until stage 10
```

**💡 Development Strategy:**
- Develop lands before selling for higher value
- Stage 10 lands are fully developed
- Each stage adds +5 resource level
- Development persists through ownership changes
- Costs only gas fees (no token payment)

**Development Benefits:**
- 📈 Higher perceived value
- 💎 Increased resource production potential
- 🏆 Shows commitment to land quality
- 💰 Justifies premium pricing

---

### 🏘️ Neighborhood & Community Features

#### 8. Create a Neighborhood
Group multiple lands into a named community:

```solidity
// Prepare array of your land IDs
uint256[] memory myLands = new uint256[](5);
myLands[0] = 30;
myLands[1] = 31;
myLands[2] = 32;
myLands[3] = 33;
myLands[4] = 34;

// Create neighborhood
createNeighborhood("Silicon Valley District", myLands)

// Requirements:
// ✅ Must own ALL lands in the array
// ✅ At least 1 land required
// ✅ Lands can only be in one neighborhood

// Returns: Neighborhood ID
```

#### 9. Add Lands to Neighborhood
Expand existing neighborhoods:

```solidity
// Add land #35 to neighborhood #2
addLandToNeighborhood(35, 2)

// Requirements:
// ✅ Must own the land
// ✅ Neighborhood must be active
// ✅ Land must NOT already be in another neighborhood
```

**💡 Neighborhood Benefits:**
- 🏘️ Build branded communities
- 📍 Group related properties
- 👥 Attract like-minded owners
- 💼 Create business districts
- 🌳 Organize themed areas

**Example Neighborhoods:**
- "Tech Campus" - Group office lands
- "Residential Hills" - Housing community
- "Coastal Resort" - Beach properties
- "Industrial Zone" - Factory cluster
- "Art District" - Creative spaces

## 💡 FAQ

### Q: Can I undo a merge or split?
**A:** No, merges and splits are permanent operations. Always double-check before executing.

### Q: What happens to development when I merge lands?
**A:** The new merged land takes the MAXIMUM development stage from all merged lands.

### Q: Do I lose resources when splitting?
**A:** Yes, each split land gets 80% of the original resource level (20% reduction).

### Q: How does rarity affect my land?
**A:** Higher rarity means higher initial resource levels and perceived value. It doesn't affect functionality but impacts market value.

### Q: Can I have a land in multiple neighborhoods?
**A:** No, each land can only be in one neighborhood at a time.

### Q: What's the maximum development stage?
**A:** Stage 10 is the maximum. Each stage adds +5 resource level.

### Q: Do I need to pay for development?
**A:** No, development only costs gas fees. There's no token payment required.

### Q: Can I remove my land from a neighborhood?
**A:** Currently, no. This feature is planned for future updates.

## 🚀 Gas Optimization Tips

### For Users:

**Reduce Gas Costs:**
- Batch operations when possible
- Merge/split during low network activity
- Use `registerLandBasic()` for simple needs
- Develop lands in bulk sessions
- Create neighborhoods with initial land set

**Gas Cost Estimates (at 20 gwei):**
- Register Land Basic: ~150,000 gas (~0.003 ETH)
- Register Land Advanced: ~200,000 gas (~0.004 ETH)
- List for Sale: ~50,000 gas (~0.001 ETH)
- Purchase Land: ~100,000 gas (~0.002 ETH)
- Merge 3 Lands: ~300,000 gas (~0.006 ETH)
- Split into 3: ~400,000 gas (~0.008 ETH)
- Develop Land: ~80,000 gas (~0.0016 ETH)
- Create Neighborhood: ~200,000 gas (~0.004 ETH)

### For Developers:

**Optimization Techniques Used:**
- Efficient data structures (mappings over arrays)
- Minimal storage writes
- Event emissions instead of storage when possible
- View functions for reads (no gas)
- Packed structs where applicable
- Deletion of unused lands (gas refunds)
